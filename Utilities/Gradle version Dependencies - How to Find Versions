if you are facing the unresolved depedencies issues during compile and runtime, here is the tips to solve:

For example,

1. in build.gradle

dependencies {
	compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.portal.kernel"
	
}

2. if you dont mention version, BND file (.bnd) will take the default version and
   add in "Import-Package" of Manifest.mf file
   
   Here portal-kernel.jar from tomcat/lib has 2.0.0 version of particular package ( mvc / json /util) ( open manifest file and check) and 
    .gradle repository has 3.6.2 version. [.gradle\caches\modules-2\files-2.1\]
   so you might get unresolved depedencies issue in runtime.

3. To solve this : add the proper version in build.gradle finding from server jar using gogoshell / manually
                      or
                   add the version ranges in .bnd as below:
                   
                   Import-Package:\
  com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc;version="[2.0.0,3.6.2)",\
  *
  
  
  or
  
  1. you can give the bundle version of portal-kernel which is there in tomcat/lib : Bundle-Version: 4.0.0

4. Unresolved requirement during runtime :
	a. find the jar from server:
		ls -s |grep "jar name"   For Ex: ls -s |grep "jackson"
	b. update the jar in build.gradle
	c. redeploy again
