By default, the plugin creates a configuration called portalCommonCSS and adds a dependency to the latest released version of the Liferay Frontend Common CSS artifact. It is possible to override this setting and use a specific version of the artifact by manually adding a dependency to the portalCommonCSS configuration:

build.gradle :

dependencies {

	portalCommonCSS group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.frontend.css.common", version: "4.0.0"

}
