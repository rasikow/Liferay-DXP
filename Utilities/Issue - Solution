ISSUE:    org.apache.jasper.JasperException: PWC6345: There is an error in invoking javac.  A full JDK (not just JRE) is required


SOLUTION:

1) I made sure my JAVA_HOME pointed to my Java JDK (1.8.0_xx) and my JRE_HOME pointed to my Java JRE (1.8.0_xx)

2) I removed the C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath; from my PATH variables (there were 2 PATH variables, removed from both)

3) Made sure my PATH variables (both) at the JDK Bin folder path: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65\bin;

Then I checked my CMD 'where java' and received the correct response: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65\bin\java.exe

4) In Eclipse, under the top menu: Windows > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs Here, I originally had the jre1.8.0_65, but I added the jdk1.8.0_65 and selected it.

5) Finally, what seemed to make the biggest difference: Right-Click on your server, and at the bottom, select Properties.
A window will open up, and the 3rd option, there's clickable text "Runtime Environment". 
Click it and a popup will open, there will be a bottom drop-down under "Select runtime JRE" Here, I selected jdk1.8.0_65

1. Gradle install issue for SunCertPathBuilder:

	Issue: PKIX path building failed:
	
	Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
	Could not install Gradle distribution from 'https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.10.2-bin.zip'.
	sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
	PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
	unable to find valid certification path to requested target	
	
	Reason : proxy firewall from your corporate network is restricted to download gradle plugin from https. So just download the certificates.

	SOLUTION: http://www.javasavvy.com/import-ssl-certificate-into-java-keystore/
        ========

         ( open the command prompt as administrator to avoid Filenotfound exception for the certificate)

	KEY tool certificate imports command:

	keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file C:\Zubair\Softwares\gradleCertificate.cer -keystore cacerts -alias "gradle"
	
	keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file C:\Zubair\Softwares\g1.cer -keystore cacerts -alias "gradle"


	1. Check java version
	2. Import certificates
	3. Manually copy the gradle inside the folder C:\Users\gk2053520\.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-4.10.2-bin\<created folder>
	4. Restart the system
